ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key

The error appears to be in '/home/adminp/prac5/install_tools.yaml': line 36, column 5, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: InstalÂ·lar kubernetes
    ^ here
